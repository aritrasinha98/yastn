Building MPO using Hterm
========================

Hamiltonian is typically given as a sum of products of local operators.
We can specify a single such product using :code:`mps.tn.mps.Hterm`.
Hamiltonian is generated by a function :code:`yastn.tn.mps.generate_mpo` which takes an identity MPO and a `list(Hterm)`.

Spinless fermions with hopping at arbitrary range
