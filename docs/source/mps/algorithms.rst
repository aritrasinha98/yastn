Algorithms for a state
=========================
# GW: I ignored the project* functions

Maximize overlap
---------------------------------

This is the procedure which performs DMRG sweep such that the initial state has the maximal ovelap with the target state.

See examples: :ref:`examples/init:clone, detach or copy tensors`.

DMRG
---------------------------------

#dmrg described brifly + test file for many symmetries

See examples: :ref:`examples/init:clone, detach or copy tensors`.

.. autoclass:: yast._dmrg

	:members: dmrg


TDVP
---------------------------------

#tdvp described brifly + test file for many symmetries

See examples: :ref:`examples/init:clone, detach or copy tensors`.
