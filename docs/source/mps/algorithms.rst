MPS based algorithms
=====================

.. todo:: I ignored the project* functions


Maximize overlap
---------------------------------

This is the procedure which performs DMRG sweep such that the initial state has the maximal ovelap with the target state.

.. automodule:: yamps
	:members: variational_sweep_1site

.. todo:: I wasn't using it a lot, maybe there is sth more to say.
DMRG
---------------------------------

#dmrg described brifly + test file for many symmetries

See examples: :ref:`examples/init:clone, detach or copy tensors`.

.. automodule:: yamps
	:members: dmrg


TDVP
---------------------------------

#tdvp described brifly + test file for many symmetries

See examples: :ref:`examples/init:clone, detach or copy tensors`.

.. automodule:: yamps
	:members: tdvp
