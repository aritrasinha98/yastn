OVERLAPS to get expectation values and overlaps
=========================

Overlaps of MPS-s
---------------------------------

#explain in graph + simple test file 

See examples: :ref:`examples/init:clone, detach or copy tensors`.

.. autoclass:: yast.Tensor
	:noindex:
	:exclude-members: __init__, __new__
	:members: copy, clone, detach


Expectation value of MPO
---------------------------------

#explain in graph + simple test file

.. autoclass:: yast.Tensor
	:noindex:
	:exclude-members: __init__, __new__
