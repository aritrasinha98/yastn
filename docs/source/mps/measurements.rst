OVERLAPS to get expectation values and overlaps
=========================

Overlaps of MPS-s
---------------------------------

#explain in graph + simple test file 

See examples: :ref:`examples/init:clone, detach or copy tensors`.

.. autoclass:: yast.Tensor
	:noindex:
	:members: measure_overlap


Expectation value of MPO
---------------------------------

#explain in graph + simple test file 

See examples: :ref:`examples/init:clone, detach or copy tensors`.

.. autoclass:: yast.Tensor
	:noindex:
	:members: measure_mpo
